# **What's This?**

A touchpad peripheral device based on ESP32-S2 + specific laptop TouchPad.

 - Compatible with Microsoft Precision TouchPad (PTP) standard.
 - Supported Windows Touch Gesture.
 - Supported Taptic Engine.
   > Taptic Engine still in development.

Also include a HP fingerprint module, in order to support fingerprint for Windows Hello.

### **Currently Touchpad Support (already tested):**
 - Lenovo ELAN 33370A TouchPad (Rev.A S8974A, traditional mechanical design)
 - XiaoMi book 2022 14/16 pro Goodix GT7863 TouchPad (Haptic Engine design)

> [!CAUTION]
> Hardware & software only support the models of the touchpad mentioned above, untested touchpad models may be incompatible. <br>Use of such models can lead to driver failure or permanent hardware damage caused by short circuits!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The pressure-sensitive touchpad promoted by Xiaomi merely replaced the traditional mechanical structure with a pressure-sensitive motor trigger, it is not a complete pressure-sensing recognition (there is no pressure-sensing feedback adjustment).<br>
> Recommand to use XiaoMi Goodix TouchPad.

# TODO List:
  ## Hardware:
  - [x] PCB Design
  - [x] Material Selection
  - [x] Appearance Design (Modeling by SOLIDWORKS)
  - [x] Adding battery to support 2.4G wireless (Fingerprint module is unavailable during 2.4G wireless state)
  - [x] Adding battery to support wireless Bluetooth (Fingerprint module is unavailable during bluetooth wireless state)
  - [ ] ~~Adding ThinkPad TrackPoint Mouse Pointer~~ (There are no current plans for this function update)
  - [ ] ~~Adding specific function button~~ (There are no current plans for this function update)

  ## Software:
  - [x] Recognized as a Microsoft Precision TouchPad
  - [x] ELAN TouchPad Support
  - [x] Goodix TouchPad Support
  - [x] **Switching From Mouse Mode (Only One Finger) to Absolute Mode (Supported Multi Finger), [thanks to @ApprehensiveAnt9858](https://www.reddit.com/r/embedded/comments/1j3c2k6/need_help_getting_and_i2c_hid_elan_touchpad_to/)**
  - [x] Single Touch Support
  - [x] Multi Touch Support
    - [x] Scroll Gesture Support
    - [x] Single Tap Support
    - [x] Multi Tap Support (It might fail to trigger occasionally)
  - [x] Physical Buttons Support (left click & right click)
  - [x] Changing from freertos polling to GPIO interrupt
  - [x] Add a new HID port to support Mouse Mode compatibility.<br>
        (available for some old systems/BIOS that doesn't support PTP, like Windows 7)
  - [x] 2.4G wireless mode support
  - [ ] Bluetooth wireleess mode support

# Current Issues:

 - ~~Two fingers tap (equal to right click) can only trigger on laptop.~~<br>
   > The triggering issue was caused by the missing of physical XY dimensions, and it has now been fixed.<br>
   > To ensure the best compatibility among different touchpad devices, the receiver will not report the PHYSICAL coordinates in default. Some functions maybe unavailable.<br>
   > If you ONLY use specific model touchpad, you can choose the model in `sdkconfig` from `2.4G` project. [For more details, please refer to "Setup & Configuration" section of the 2.4G receiver.](https://github.com/barryblueice/ESP32-Precision-TouchPad/wiki/Setup%20&%20Configuration)
 - ~~Multi-Port HID compatibility design may not support on some old system, like Windows XP.~~<br>
   > This was caused by a bug in the HID Descriptor I programmed, and it has now been fixed.
 - ~~Cannot perform rapid and consecutive clicks.~~
   > This was caused by missing of confidence & Tip in the HID message, and it has now been fixed.
 - Due to processor limitation, Original PTP Mode can only support wire connect/2.4G wireless mode. <br>Bluetooth mode needs to use ESP32-S3.
   > The new project [ESP32 Haptic Precision TouchPad](https://github.com/barryblueice/ESP32-Haptic-Precision-TouchPad) supports Bluetooth, 2.4G and wired connections. Still in development currently.
