# **What's This?**

Another touchpad hacking project, based on ESP32-S3 + Surface Laptop Studio 1964 Synaptics TouchPad.

 - Compatible with Microsoft Precision TouchPad (PTP) standard.
 - Supported Windows Touch Gesture.
 - Supported Haptic Engine.
 - Supported feedback adjustment.
 - Supported USB/BLE/2.4G connection.

Also include a Dell Goodix fingerprint module, in order to support fingerprint for Windows Hello.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project is basically an expanded and strengthened version of an existing project [ESP32 Precision TouchPad](https://github.com/barryblueice/ESP32-Precision-TouchPad).<br>
> Most of the functions will be developed by referring to the source code of previous projects.<br>
> So the basic functions of these two projects are the same. This project has added more new features.

> [!CAUTION]
> Hardware & software only support the models of the touchpad mentioned above, untested touchpad models may be incompatible. <br>Use of such models can lead to driver failure or permanent hardware damage caused by short circuits!

> [!TIP]
> This project utilized AI-assisted development during its development process.

# TODO List

## Hardware
- [x] PCB Design
- [x] Appearance Design (Modeling in SOLIDWORKS)

## Software

### General Support
- [x] Recognized as a Microsoft Precision TouchPad
- [x] **Switching from Mouse Mode (single finger) to Absolute Mode (multi-finger supported)**

### Touch Support
- [x] Single Touch
- [x] Multi Touch
  - [x] Scroll Gesture
  - [x] Single Tap
  - [x] Multi Tap

### Physical Controls
- [x] Physical Buttons (Left & Right Click)

### Compatibility
- [x] Add new HID port for Mouse Mode (for older systems/BIOS, e.g., Windows 7)
- [x] PTP Simulated Mouse Mode

### Wireless Modes
- [x] 2.4G Wireless
  - [x] Compatible with [ESP32-Precision-TouchPad](https://github.com/barryblueice/ESP32-Precision-TouchPad)
- [x] Bluetooth
  - [x] Mouse Mode
  - [ ] PTP Mode

### Haptic Feedback
- [x] Hacking on Haptic Sensitivity
  - [x] CS40L25 SDK Support
  - [x] ROM Vibrate
  - [x] Specific waveform firmware (experimental)
- [x] Haptic Support
  - [x] Click Sensitivity Adjustment (experimental)
  - [x] Haptic Click & Intensity Adjustment (experimental)
  - [ ] Haptic Feedback & Intensity Control (tentative)

# Current Issues:
 -  Under BLE mode, Windows has recieved HID report, but most of gestures are unavailable, only a few gesture like 4 fingers tap can trigger.<br>
 Also, Windows Setting for PTP is unavailable under BLE mode.
 - Under BLE mode, PTP/Mouse Mode switching is unavailable, so BLE Mouse Mode will be default currently.
 - ~~Due to a firmware issue with the CS40L25, the vibration feedback when pressed could be strange.~~ <br>Vibration feedback has already fixed through reverse-engineering firmware & control logic by Surface SAM and CS40L25 firmware.

# Current Support System (already tested):

 - Windows XP (Mouse Mode);
 - Windows 7 (Mouse Mode);
 - Windows 10/11 (PTP Mode);
 - Ubuntu 22.04 or newer (PTP Mode);
 - Oxygen OS 17 (based on Android 16) on PHK110 (PTP Mode);
 - HP / MSI BIOS (Mouse Mode)
